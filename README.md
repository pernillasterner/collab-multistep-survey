# collab-multistep-survey
This repository contains a collaborative project to build a multistep survey form using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). Users will be guided through a series of questions in a multistep format and receive a summary of their responses at the end. All survey data will be stored in MongoDB.
